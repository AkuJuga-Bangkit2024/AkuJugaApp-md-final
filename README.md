About The Project
--
Human beings are not infallible. While some individuals may possess certain advantages, others may suffer from certain disadvantages. Speech and hearing impairments are examples of conditions that can adversely affect a person's ability to communicate through the mouth and ears. Such individuals may appear to be physically indistinguishable from the rest of society, but their communication abilities may differ. They may speak without sound, with muddled articulation, or may not be able to speak at all. To communicate with others, they may employ sign language, which is not always comprehensible to those not familiar with it, resulting in social inequality.

To address this issue, we have created a project aimed at creating teaching materials that can impart sign language skills to those who are unfamiliar with it. We have developed a mobile learning application, called “#AkuJuga”, which can be used as a teaching tool on mobile devices. With this application, those with hearing impairments can learn sign language more easily at any time and from any location. By employing such a tool, individuals can improve their communication skills and achieve greater parity and equality in their daily lives.
